# Text-Editor-in-C-
This is a text editor built in C++ th the capability to save changes, edit history, undo, redo, scroll.

This project was created as a response to one of the projects floating around in my C++ classes. Since C++ is the first language I learned how to code, I thought a project like this would
be interesting enough to test my problem solving skills.

This project took me 2 weeks to make, and I think the most challenging part of this project was implementing the scroll functionality.
